A sample of some of the causal inference work I have done in the past.

Following Rubin's model of causality, one of the fundamental difficulties of causal inference is the lack of certainty in the ground truth. Therefore, my approach to solving causal inference problems is to apply as many different, relevant approaches as possible to increase confidence in estimates. If multiple approaches result in similar treatment effect estimates, then we can be more confident that a causal relationship truly exists in the data.
